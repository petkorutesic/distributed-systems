                  <li>Lamport's logical clocks can be used to implement total
                  ordering multicast</li>
                  <li>each message is timestamped with the current (logical) time
                  of it's sender</li>
                  <li>when process receives the message it put it into a local
                      queue, ordered according to its timestamp</li>
                  <li> receiver multicast an acknowledgement to other processes.</li>
                  <li> goal is that all processes have the <b>same copy</b> of the
                      <b>local queue</b></li>
                  <li>message is delivered to application when it's at the head
                      of the queue and has acknowledgement by each other process
